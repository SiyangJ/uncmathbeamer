# uncmathbeamer

This is a minimal beamer theme that has some elements built in aimed towards UNC Chapel Hill 
(where I did my PhD). These can be modified fairly easily working from the example useage in example_slides.tex.

Features include:
- Removal of unnecessary boundaries present in most default beamer styles which would cut down on screen real estate
- Three-color scheme: black, grey, and Carolina blue.
- Replaced the garish default beamer enumerate (blue dots with numbers inside) with a simple numbering.
- (Optional) logo on the upper right (the example slides use the "old well" UNC-CH logo)
- None of the usual "doodads" that are present in default beamer (I have never seen anyone use any of these, frankly)
- No page numberings (you can make an argument for having them, but in my experience as an audience member and presenter, 
you don't want your audience staring at how many pages are left in your presentation.)

In a sentence, the purpose was mainly to have a broadly useable Beamer style 
while "stripping the fat" from typical beamer styles. 
I'm happy to take suggestions for improvements; don't hesitate to contact me through github or email.
